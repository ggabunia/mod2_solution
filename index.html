					Brutha
				</h2>
				<p>
					Brutha was the Eighth Prophet of Omnianism. He started out as a novice in the Citadel under Brother Nhumrod, and was known to the other novices as "the big dumb ox" (much like St Thomas Aquinas). He might not have advanced any further, were it not for his prodigious memory, which brought him to the attention of Deacon Vorbis.

					Vorbis
				</h2>
				<p>
					Deacon Vorbis was the head of the Omnian Quisition during the early life of Brutha. He was undoubtedly the most feared man in Omnia, and pursued the Church's imperialistic goals with incredible zeal. Despite his fanatical devotion, for the greater part of his life he did not rise above the position of Deacon, a result of his position in the Quisition.

					Lu-Tze 
				</h2>
				<p>
					Lu-Tze is a sweeper, but also goes on missions normally reserved for senior History Monks. That means that he makes sure that history happens the way it is supposed to. His function as a mere sweeper shouldn't allow that, but he has a special relationship with the Abbot of which little detail is revealed. He has once started training as a monk, but went on.
